This folder contains the config settings for different projects. 
This allows us to prepare app layouts for different projects and make sure the right config settings are chosen when setting up a new phone for that project.

The config file has to be modified for each subject in the upper part as specified by the comments. The config file is then renamed to "RESpeck.config" and placed into the root directory of the phone/tablet.

"Everything - RESpeck.config" has every setting enabled for testing purposes.
